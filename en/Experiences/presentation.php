    <p>
      Currently in first graduate year at Grenoble INP - Génie industriel, a school specialized in industrial engineering. I have always been thrilled by computer science and new technologies.

      I discovered the world of computer science in middle school thanks to GNU/Linux and since then I spend a lot of time browsing the web trying to learn everything I possibly could : programming (Java, Caml, C, ...), text formating with LaTeX and elecronics with Arduino.

      Beeing engineer is my dream, this is why I follow this path of studies : after 2 years of preparatory school for the french Grandes Écoles (specialized in Mathematics and Physics), I entered Grenoble INP - Génie industriel. I hope to be able to link my work to my passion for new technologies.
